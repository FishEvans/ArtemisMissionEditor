* [MAIN TODO] Acknowledge expressions as valid values:
  - at first, at least decide wether it's a numeric value or not, and if it's a numeric value, suggest if there's an error (like, out of range or decimal point in integer value)
  - then, learn to actually parse expressions and check them for errors (like, invalid symbols) 
   (NOTE: variable names CAN start with numbers, and variable name has a priority over a constant, so if variable "123" is defined as 7, setting a var to 123 will set it to 7)
  - then, learn to distinguish variable names, and suggest where variable with such a name does not exist



* Check for common mistake of NOT changing at least one variable that is in the condition list. Suggest this somehow to the user (this is still allowed)

* BUG! Convert comms/etc [Is this bug there anymore? Was it fixed long time ago?...]
* Somehow show how many spaces there are in names consisting only of them [David: Dosen't 1.7 disallow this now?]
* Text description for all properties on space map [Is this done already?]
* Convert to comment/from comment for statements [Is this done already?]



TODO's for the DISTANT FUTURE

1. Selection:
* Multiselect with one click (ctrl_click)
* Drag and drop whole selection?

2. Add MANDATORY wherever it is needed by the game

3. [Forgot what this means] Icons for actions? 

4. [Probably pointless] Allow editing set_property statements also on the space map,
The way mission scripting parsing works, you should not set object properties in the statement where you create an object.
Therefore, allowing this would not be worth it.
